Place listeners here. You can place single .class files or jar files with your listeners. 
You can also place other classes in a jar file which you need as library.
Don't place your listeners in a package.
A listener need to implement 'org.bukkit.event.Listener'.
The listeners work like all other bukkit listeners. Don't register them.
You can use all events in your listeners (Bukkit- and GrandTheftDiamond events).
